# Hello there
I'm MostlyTurquoise, a gay wavedashing magic space alien / sentient computer virus from another dimension.

I use `they/them` pronouns, although other pronouns are also fine. My favourite colour switches between Turquoise, Yellow, and Pink. I would like to deny the printer allegations - but if I was a printer, I would be laser rather than inkjet. If I could pick any flavour for my skin to be, I would pick vanilla - good enough that its kinda nice, generic enough that no one will dislike it, but also not interesting enough that people would want to lick me. I like rust and ts/js the most, however I have written in a bunch of others. I am currently obsessed with NixOS and Rust (ik how unique). I am a cat person, although dogs are also amazing. This is larry: '[O-O]' find him in my repos and open an issue with his location for imaginary internet points. I will have a personal website at some point. Until then this is the best you are getting. I would link all my social medias but I am MostlyTurquoise in most places - although out there on the internet is my mortal enemy, a different MostlyTurquoise, with whom I battle across the intergalactic battleground of who gets the username on each site. Although this mortal enemy seems to have gone inactive slightly... I would say this has potential for an epic friendship, but they are (or were) an nft artist. Alas. I think I have rambled enough now though. Take care besties :D
